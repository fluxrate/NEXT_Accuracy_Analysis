/home/ben33/next_paper

is a fresh directory to work from.

$ chmod a+rw -R /home/ben33/NEXT_project/

has been run and should (hopefully) guarantee the ability of myself, Ryan, and Nick to all edit (read, write)
files in the "next_paper" directory.

Notice that NEXTDNN git directory has been cloned INSIDE of dlkit, which was one of myself and Nick's original
issues.

Make sure first thing before running any training, to be inside the dlkit directory and run the setup.sh file with:
$ . setup.sh

to run a training, the syntax is as expected (assuring that you are inside dlkit):

$ python -m NEXTDNN.ClassificationExperiment.py

Loading a model should simply be the above + the addition of the following flag

--LoadModel /path/to/model

which in our case, all of our models will be in the TrainedModels directory. So:

$ python -m NEXTDNN.ClassificationExperiment.py --LoadModel /TrainedModels/[[Saved Model Name Here]]






Problems:

Dense layers have hardcoded output dimensions.

Pooling or Conv3D require 5 input dim : batchsize channels then dim1 2 3
with channels_first
default is channels_last
since don't really have 'channels' consider Conv2D

What is self.inputT=input
and self.modelT=modelT
