###What is DLKit?
_A library that makes deep learning easy..._

Often it is difficult to wire up all the things necessary to start training with Deep Neural Networks on large datasets.
In order to combat this barrier to entry, libraries such as Keras and TensorFlow, Theano, Scikit-Learn, etc., are used
to do the heavy lifting for you. However, it seems that these libraries all leave out important pieces that really unlock
the potential of your hardware. There is a demand for a framework that combines all of these great tools together and
make it easier than ever to dive into scalable Deep Learning without the hassle of looking under the hood.
