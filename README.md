# NEXT_Accuracy_Analysis
Clone of NEXTDNN inside DLKit | Test detector resolution effect on DNN accuracy  

In dlkit is NEXT_Experiment.ipynb use this to run the models:  
In dlkit/NEXTDNN is Original_3D_Sequential.py if you want to run the original attempt at using Conv3D (it will not work)  
also inside dlkit/NEXTDNN is Conv_Sequential.py, to run the working (but inaccurate) model.
