# NEXT_Accuracy_Analysis
Clone of NEXTDNN inside DLKit | Test detector resolution effect on DNN accuracy  

In the dlkit directory is NEXT_Experiment.ipynb. Use this to run the models.   
In dlkit/NEXTDNN is Original_3D_Sequential.py if you want to see/edit the original attempt at using Conv3D (it will not work)  
also inside dlkit/NEXTDNN is Conv_Sequential.py, to see/edit the working (but inaccurate) model.
